### Patch Changes

- [#300](https://github.com/web-widget/create-web-widget/pull/300) [`0ca13bb`](https://github.com/web-widget/create-web-widget/commit/0ca13bb8de64b2329bae04f7bf92b1e9fcb5c47a) Thanks [@joeldenning](https://github.com/joeldenning)! - Breaking Changes

  - NodeJS >= 12.13.0 now required, as we're using [style-loader@3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0) in webpack-config-web-widget

  Projects generated by web-widget

  - New projects use Jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Newly generated projects use React 17 types
  - Newly generated projects now use concurrently 6. See https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/releases/tag/v6.0.0
  - Newly generated root configs and util modules now execute `git init` during creation
  - Newly generated projects now use eslint-config-prettier 8. See https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#version-800-2021-02-21

  Internal changes

  - Upgrade yargs to 17 in create-web-widget, which parses the CLI args. See https://github.com/yargs/yargs/releases/tag/v17.0.0
  - Upgrade yeoman-environment to v3 and yeoman-generator to v5. This comes with changes to how packages are installed by yeoman, but those changes don't apply to create-web-widget because only committed package.jsons result in yeoman-environment installs. Manually installing dependencies the old way via yeoman-generator.

  Maintenance

  - Upgrade to jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Upgrade create-web-widget to husky 6. Upgrade newly generated projects to use husky 6
  - Add `scripts/update-dependencies.sh` script for maintainers to easily upgrade all dependencies at once
